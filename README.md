This project is for integrating my toolsets for bootstrap my reactjs project which includes,the reactjs, es6, karma, karma-fixture, jasmine, some simple jasmin test sample, and more.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the [Create React App] guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

The set up Karma with Jasmine in Create React App idea is from the guide [here](https://github.com/IntrepidPursuits/react-page-object/blob/master/docs/faq/installation-karma-jasmine.md).

The [karma-fixture](https://github.com/billtrik/karma-fixture) is using for loading the fixtures of the tests.

I'll eventually be adding more tools which is required by myself.

Added react-redux, react-router-redux, react-redux with sample code.
